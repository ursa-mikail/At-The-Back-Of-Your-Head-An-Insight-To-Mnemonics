# Principles of Mnemonics

* Mnemonics will only work when the memory is shocked or surprised to glitch and activate a memory write. Hence, stale plain impressions won't work.

* "Put yourself in the person's shoe"
When the characters may be confused eg. Xiang Yu and Napoleon Bonaparte, use very distinct story which is related to only them distinctly.
Give the stpry a strong / poignant plot. Why are they there in the 1st place?
o Your brain remembers * feeding, fucking, fun, fulfillment. Think of the box of chocolate, you likely remember weeks later which ones to go for once preferred. 

For ‘0’, instead of ‘S’ or ‘Z’, ‘null’ may be used, e.g. * _02. (null) B.
